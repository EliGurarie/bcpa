## Resubmission

This is an resubmission of an update of an existing release.  I believe I've fixed the warnings / notes pointed out here: https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/noSuggests/bcpa.out.

I believe most of these have to do with some dependencies in the examples, notably of `circular` (fatal) and `stats` (minor).  

Otherwise, I have updated the documentation, Roxynated all of the help files, improved some key examples, and added a new vignette (for unidimensional analysis).
