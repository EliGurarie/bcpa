Description: The Behavioral Change Point Analysis (BCPA) is a method of
    identifying hidden shifts in the underlying parameters of a time series,
    developed specifically to be applied to animal movement data which is
    irregularly sampled.  The method is based on: E. Gurarie, R. Andrews and 
    K. Laidre A novel method for identifying behavioural changes in animal 
    movement data (2009) Ecology Letters 12:5 395-408. A development version is 
    on <https://github.com/EliGurarie/bcpa>. NOTE: the BCPA method may be useful 
    for any univariate, irregularly sampled Gaussian time-series, but animal 
    movement analysts are encouraged to apply correlated velocity change point 
    analysis as implemented in the smoove package, as of this writing on GitHub 
    at <https://github.com/EliGurarie/smoove>. An example of a univariate analysis
    is provided in the UnivariateBCPA vignette.
