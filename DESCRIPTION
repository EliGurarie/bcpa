Description: The Behavioral Change Point Analysis (BCPA) is a method of
    identifying hidden shifts in the underlying parameters of a time series,
    developed specifically to be applied to animal movement data which is
    irregularly sampled.  The method is based on: E.
    Gurarie, R. Andrews and K. Laidre A novel method for identifying
    behavioural changes in animal movement data (2009) Ecology Letters 12:5
    395-408. NOTE: the method may be useful for any univariate, irregularly sampled Gaussian time-series, 
    but animal movement analysts are encouraged to apply correlated velocity change point analysis as implemented 
    in the smoove package, as of this writing on GitHub at https://github.com/EliGurarie/smoove.
